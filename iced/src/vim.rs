//! Vim's grammar, and the one hook a component implements to get it.
//!
//! Three things are kept apart on purpose, because each is useful without the
//! others and mixing them is what makes keyboard code untestable:
//!
//! 1. **[`Keys`] turns key presses into an [`Action`].** It knows `5j` is five
//!    downs and `gg` is the top, and nothing about what is on screen. It is a
//!    state machine over characters and can be tested by pressing letters at
//!    it.
//! 2. **[`Navigate`] turns a [`Motion`] into a new cursor.** This is the hook.
//!    A component says how many cells it has and where a motion lands; it gets
//!    counts, `gg`, `G` and `{count}G` for free, and never sees a key.
//! 3. **The application does the rest** — which pane has the cursor, what
//!    `Activate` means, what the search text matches against. None of that
//!    generalises, so none of it is here.
//!
//! The part worth explaining is what [`Navigate::step`] returning `None`
//! means: *not mine*. A vertical [`List`] refuses `h` and `l` because it has no
//! horizontal axis at all, and the caller is then free to read that as "leave
//! this pane" — which is how the sidebar and the track list are moved between
//! without either of them knowing the other exists. A [`Grid`] accepts all
//! four and clamps at its edges, because it *does* have both axes: there the
//! motion was mine and there was simply nowhere further to go. Refusing and
//! clamping are different answers to different questions, and keeping them
//! apart is what lets one grammar serve a list, a row and a grid.
