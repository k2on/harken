//! In a browser this is an `<audio>` element the page owns. Handing it a URL
//! buys streaming, buffering, range requests and seeking from the platform —
//! four problems that are the browser's job and would each have to be solved
//! again to play the same bytes from Rust.
//!
//! On the desktop nothing is wired to an audio device. That is a real gap and
//! not a hidden one: [`Player::AUDIBLE`] says so, the now-playing bar reads it,
//! and a track selected there is shown rather than silently pretended to play.
//! Closing it means a decoder and an output device (`rodio`, so `cpal`, so
//! ALSA) plus an HTTP reader to feed them — worth doing when the desktop
//! client has a media store to stream from, which it does not yet.
